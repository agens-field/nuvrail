/api/v1/operations endpoints — Milestone 1.0.

GET    /operations              — list (optional ?status= filter)
GET    /operations/{op_id}      — single operation detail
POST   /operations/batch/approve — approve multiple operations
POST   /operations/batch/reject  — reject multiple operations
POST   /operations/{op_id}/approve  — approve + execute against upstream
POST   /operations/{op_id}/reject   — reject

Approve logic:
  - SMTP ops: relay via aiosmtplib to upstream SMTP server (STARTTLS)
  - IMAP ops: open a fresh aioimaplib connection to upstream, replay the
    stored raw IMAP command, close connection. Supports: STORE, UID STORE,
    MOVE, UID MOVE, COPY, UID COPY, CREATE, RENAME. APPEND is skipped
    (message body not stored in staging DB — deferred to later milestone).

Execution flow for IMAP:

  approve request
      │
      ▼
  open fresh IMAP4_SSL → blizzard.mxrouting.net:993
      │  LOGIN (plain credentials from env)
      │
      ▼
  SELECT folder_from  (for STORE/MOVE/COPY — folder context required)
      │
      ▼
  replay command (uid store / uid move / uid copy / create / rename)
      │
      ▼
  LOGOUT → close connection
      │
      ▼
  update staged_operations status → 'executed'
  insert audit_log event='executed'

Route ordering note: batch routes (/operations/batch/approve and
/operations/batch/reject) are registered BEFORE the parameterised route
/operations/{op_id}/approve so FastAPI does not treat 'batch' as an op_id.
