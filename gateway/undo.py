"""
Undo of approved+executed operations — the inverse of gateway.execution.

Reverses an executed IMAP operation within the undo window (default 24h).
Lives next to the forward executor (gateway.execution) and shares its
credential-resolution and JSON-field helpers, so the forward and inverse
mailbox-mutating commands sit side by side in one layer.

Data flow:
  POST /api/v1/operations/{id}/undo
       │
       ├─ load operation row from staged_operations
       │   ├─ status must be 'executed'
       │   ├─ undo_expires_at must be > now
       │   └─ op_type must be in UNDOABLE_OP_TYPES
       │
       ├─ move/trash/archive only (#170): load the destination UIDs +
       │   UIDVALIDITY the forward MOVE recorded (COPYUID) from the
       │   'executed' audit row; missing → refuse (never guess a UID)
       │
       ├─ resolve_imap_credentials() (shared with the forward executor)
       │
       ├─ execute the inverse IMAP command
       │
       └─ mark operation status → 'reverted', insert audit_log event

Inverse strategies:
  move      → SELECT folder_to; UIDVALIDITY must match the recorded one;
              UID MOVE <recorded dest UIDs> → folder_from. The undo MOVE
              must itself return COPYUID, else nothing moved → refuse.
  trash     → same as move, out of folder_to (Trash)
  mark_read → UID STORE -FLAGS (\\Seen)   [was +FLAGS]
  mark_unread→UID STORE +FLAGS (\\Seen)   [was -FLAGS]
  star      → UID STORE -FLAGS (\\Flagged)[was +FLAGS]
  unstar    → UID STORE +FLAGS (\\Flagged)[was -FLAGS]
  archive   → same as move

  Why not reuse message_ids: IMAP UIDs are per-mailbox. message_ids are the
  SOURCE folder's UIDs; in folder_to the message has a new UID, and the old
  number may belong to an unrelated message (or to nothing, which used to
  report a false 'reverted').

Operations NOT undoable in Phase 2:
  smtp_send — message already sent (or not yet; reverting is a cancel, not an undo)
  copy      — we don't track which UID was created in folder_to
  append    — body not stored in DB
  create    — folder DELETE is destructive; Phase 3
  rename    — requires re-rename; Phase 3
